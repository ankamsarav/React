step 1: setup html environment with react and jsxtransformer.jsx

Step 2: The Tweet Box Using React.js

Step 3: Tweet Button Should Initially Be Disabled

Step 4: Implementing State and count chars (binding)

In jQuery, when some event happens, you usually change the DOM

In React, you don't directly modify the DOM. Instead, in an event handler, you modify something called the "state". 
And this is done by calling this.setState

see the code: when you type text, button is enabled else disabled

In jQuery, you write event handlers which modify the DOM.
In React.js, you write event handlers which modify the state. 
And you write render() to reflect the current state.

Step 5: add photo

In React, event handlers modify the "state", 
and whenever the state is modified, React automatically calls render() 
again to update the UI.

The state becomes an intermediary thing which sits in between the event handlers and render():

Event handlers don't need to worry about which part of the DOM changes. 
They just need to set the state.
Similarly, when you write render(), 
all you need to worry about is what the current state is.
